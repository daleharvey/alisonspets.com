        Hi! I am Alison and I offer Dog Walking and Pet Sitting
        services in Fife and Dundee, let me tell you a little
        more about myself:
      </h3>
      <p>
        Since leaving the RAF in the ‘80s, I have had a varied collection of pets from dogs, cats, rabbits, a chinchilla and a cockatiel, all leading a full happy and healthy life. I currently have Indy (Border Collie), Bailey and Murphy my moggies or as I like to call them, my fur babies :-)
      </p>
      <p>
        After a long career in Administration I have started to do full time what I have done for friends and family for many years, walking dogs and looking after pets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking after other peoples’ pets is a lot of responsibility so I have taken the NarpsUK Business Course (National Association of Pet Sitting and Dog Walking) to update my skillset from a normal pet owner to a responsible and knowledgeable Pet Sitter / Dog Walker so that I may give you the best service possible, I also intend to extend this to dog training.
      </p>

        Feel free to browse my website and have a look at the testimonials and if you require any further information please do not hesitate to contact me.

          “Alison has looked after my wee dog since he was a puppy. She has helped me train him and really helped with techniques when he got too boisterous. Wallace is my family and I trust Alison wholeheartedly with my boy. He always comes home knackered and well exercised. He gets very excited when he sees her. “ - <em>Lisa Lynch</em>

          “Alison has taken care of my dog Caoimhe (Keeva) on several occasions. Caoimhe is always excited to spend some quality time with Alison & the other animals there at the time. Alison is very professional in her care & my dog always comes home in a happy & healthy condition. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Alison Harvey if you were looking for someone to take care of your animal.” - <em>Andrew Tomlinson</em>

          “Alison has looked after my dogs and cats regularly for a few years. She has also stayed in my house to do this while I have been away on holiday. All my pets have been well cared for by Alison and I can relax knowing that both my home and my pets are in good hands while I'm away. Alison is knowledgeable and attentive to the care of my pets and are always healthy and happy when I return. She goes above and beyond the basic care, not just feeding and walking but spending time playing and interacting with my pets, she has been known to curl up on the settee with the cats for a few hours too! I can totally recommend Alison to take care of your pets.” - <em>Carol Page</em>
